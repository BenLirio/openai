Types of embedding models
- Ada (2<<10 dimensions)
- Babbage (2<<11 dimensions)
- Curie (2<<12 dimensions)
- Davinci (2<<11 + 2<<12 dimensions)

Babbage embeddings are twice as large as Ada embeddings
Curie embeddings are twice as large as Babbage embedding
Davinci embeddings are as large as Babbage and Curie combined

These embeddings are used for
- Similarity (Clustering, regression, anomaly, detection, visualization)
- Text search (Search, context relevance, information retrieval)
- Code Search (Code search and relevance)
